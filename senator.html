My role will be to facilitate and lobby for national support for these collaborative ventures. <br>Enhancing Public Participation in County Governance: I will advocate for stronger national frameworks that mandate genuine public participation in county decision-making processes, from budget formulation to development planning. My oversight will ensure our county government provides accessible platforms for citizens to voice their needs and hold leaders accountable. <br>Resolution of Inter-Governmental Disputes & Policy Harmony: I will utilize the Senate's role to mediate and resolve disputes between our county government and national government entities, ensuring smooth implementation of devolution. My legislative work will also focus on ensuring national policies are harmonized with county development plans, avoiding conflicts and promoting synergistic growth.</p>

My legislative focus will be on strengthening the legal framework for revenue sharing to prevent arbitrary cuts or delays. <br>Strict Oversight & Accountability for County Funds: I commit to rigorous oversight of all national funds allocated to our county government, ensuring every shilling is spent transparently and achieves its intended impact. I will demand regular reports, conduct thorough investigations into misuse of funds, and advocate for strong penalties for corruption to protect taxpayer money. <br>Protecting County Assets & Resources: I will tirelessly work to protect our county's land, natural resources, and strategic assets from national encroachment or mismanagement. Through legislation and oversight, I will ensure that any national policies affecting our resources are consultative, fair, and primarily benefit the residents of our county.</p>
