                <p class="paragraph-text" data-aos="fade-left" data-aos-duration="1000" data-aos-delay="400">Vision: To drive economic empowerment and sustainable development in our constituency by championing effective national policies and ensuring direct investment where it matters most. <br>Education Transformation & Access: I will advocate for equitable distribution of national education resources, pushing for policies that ensure every public school in our constituency receives adequate funding for infrastructure, teaching materials, and technology. Through the CDF, I will prioritize building and renovating classrooms, establishing modern laboratories, and supporting bursaries for needy students to ensure no child is left behind. <br>Economic Development & Job Creation: My focus in Parliament will be to champion legislation that supports local industries, offers tax incentives for businesses to invest in our constituency, and enhances the ease of doing business for SMEs. I will actively work to connect our youth and skilled laborers with national and international employment opportunities, and utilize CDF to fund vocational training programs aligned with market demands. <br>Roads & Connectivity: I will tirelessly lobby the national government for the upgrade and expansion of key national roads passing through or connecting to our constituency. Furthermore, I will ensure transparent and efficient allocation of CDF to construct and maintain feeder roads, improving accessibility for farmers to markets and residents to essential services.</p>

My oversight role will ensure that these funds and services actually reach the intended beneficiaries in our constituency, free from corruption. Through CDF, I will support local initiatives that care for vulnerable groups and community support networks. <br>Public Service Oversight & Accountability: I will relentlessly use my parliamentary powers to scrutinize national government ministries and agencies responsible for delivering services in our constituency, from land services to civil registration. I will hold regular public forums to gather feedback and use this to demand accountability and better service delivery for our people. <br>Constitutional & Electoral Reforms: I will actively participate in parliamentary debates to advocate for electoral reforms that enhance fairness, transparency, and the integrity of our democratic process. I will also push for legislative amendments that strengthen devolution, ensuring our county and constituency receive their rightful share of national resources without undue political interference</p>
