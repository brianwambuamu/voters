Our approach emphasizes dialogue, conflict resolution, and fostering strong relationships between citizens and local law enforcement. <br>Water: We pledge to invest in community-managed boreholes, rainwater harvesting projects, and rehabilitation of natural water sources to ensure sustainable and equitable water access. We will support local water committees to maintain infrastructure and manage resources effectively, reducing reliance on distant supplies.</p>
